Base Instructions Format
In RISC-V, the base instruction format is a 32-bit instruction word divided into several fields. The basic format consists of opcode, rd (destination register), funct3 (function 3), rs1 (source register 1), imm (immediate value), and funct7 (function 7). This design allows for a wide range of instructions while maintaining simplicity and flexibility, which are key principles of the RISC-V architecture.

RISC-V REGISTER FILE:
The RISC-V register file is a key component of the RISC-V architecture, providing a set of storage locations for holding data during the execution of instructions. The register file is organized into a set of integer registers and floating-point registers, depending on the extensions implemented in the processor. Registers play a crucial role in the RISC-V architecture, as they enable fast access to data and help improve the performance and efficiency of the processor.
